# SDET-AI-AGENTS

Hey! I'm working on a super cool project using AI to automate web application testing and maintenance. 

The idea is to create agents that can:

1. *Run existing automation scripts:*  These scripts check if the web app is working as expected.
2. *Fix broken scripts:* If the web app changes, the scripts might break. The AI will automatically identify and fix these issues.
3. *Keep the scripts up-to-date:*  As the web app evolves, new scripts need to be added or existing ones updated. The AI will handle this too.

I'm using powerful AI models like Groq and Google's Gemini to power these agents. They can analyze code, understand web app changes, and even write new scripts!

It's still early days, but I'm excited about the potential of this project to make web app development more efficient and reliable.

Project Overview
This project is a workflow automation tool utilizing AI-powered agents to execute, maintain, and update Python automation scripts for a web application. The goal is to ensure the web application's functionality and performance are consistently monitored and improved.

Key Features
Agents
The workflow consists of three AI-powered agents:

Script Runner: Executes existing Python automation scripts, captures outputs, logs issues, and provides detailed reports.
Script Healer: Automatically identifies and fixes failures in automation scripts caused by web application changes.
Script Maintainer: Ensures automation scripts are up-to-date with the web application by adding new scripts for newly added pages, elements, and functionalities.
Tools
The agents utilize the following tools:

PythonExecutorTool: Executes Python scripts.
ReportingTool: Generates reports.
ScriptAnalyzerTool: Analyzes script failures.
WebInspectorTool: Inspects the web application for changes.
ScriptEditorTool: Modifies scripts to restore functionality.
ScriptGeneratorTool: Generates new scripts.
VersionControlTool: Manages version control.
Language Models
The agents are powered by two language models:

Groq-llm: A ChatGroq model with an API key.
Gemini-llm: A ChatGoogleGenerativeAI model with a Google API key.


Volunteer Opportunities
We are looking for volunteers to help with the following tasks:

Testing and Debugging: Help test the agents and tools, and identify and fix bugs.
Documentation: Assist in creating and updating documentation for the project.
Feature Development: Contribute to the development of new features and tools.
Maintenance: Help maintain the project's codebase and ensure it remains up-to-date.
